     1	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
     2	Don't worry, spiders,
     3	I keep house
     4	casually.The bustle in a house
     5	The morning after death
     6	Is solemnest of industries
     7	Enacted upon earth,â€”
     8	
     9	The sweeping up the heart,
    10	And putting love away
    11	We shall not want to use again
    12	Until eternity.
